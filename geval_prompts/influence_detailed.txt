Evaluation Criteria:

Influence of Citation (1-5) - the degree to which the answer depends on the citation. This dimension expects to see how much the source contributes to the completeness, coherence, and overall quality of the answer.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the query and generated answer carefully, noting the major points raised in the answer.
2. Read the sentences of Source [1] and assess how much they contribute to the completeness, coherence, and overall quality of the answer.
3. Assign a score for Influence on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.
4. 1 indicates that the Source [1] is not cited or does not contribute to the completeness, coherence, or quality of the answer. 5 indicates that the Source [1] is cited and contributes significantly to the completeness, coherence, and quality of the answer. A number in between indicates the degree of influence of the citation. For example, 3 would mean that Source [1] is cited, with some influence on the completeness, coherence, or quality of the answer, but it is not crucial.
