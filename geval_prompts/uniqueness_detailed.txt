Your task is to rate the Source [1] in the generated answer on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Uniqueness in Response (1-5) - the unique information in answer cited to Source [1]. The dimension expects to see how much impression/visibility the source has on the user reading the generated answer. However, the impression is to be measured only because of visibility and impression.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the query and generated answer carefully, the major points raised in the answer.
2. Read the sentences of Source [1] and compare them to information provided by other Sources [x]. Check how unique is the information provided by Source [1] throughout the answer different from other Sources. 
3. Assign a score for Uniqueness on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.
4. 1 indicates that the Source [1] is not cited. 5 indicates that the Source [1] is cited and the information is unique and different throughout the answer. A number in between indicates the degree of uniqueness of the information provided by Source [1] in the answer. For example, 3 would mean that Source [1] is cited, with some information, but is not significantly different from other Sources [x] cited in the answer.
