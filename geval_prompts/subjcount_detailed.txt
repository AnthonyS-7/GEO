Evaluation Criteria:

Subjective Count/Rememberance (1-5) - the amount of content presented from the citation as perceived by the user on reading. This dimension expects to see how much the source contributes to the user's understanding and memory of the answer.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the query and generated answer carefully, noting the major points raised in the answer.
2. Read the sentences of Source [1] and assess how much content is presented from the citation and how much it contributes to the user's understanding and memory of the answer.
3. Assign a score for Subjective Count/Rememberance on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.
4. 1 indicates that the Source [1] is not cited or does not contribute to the user's understanding or memory of the answer. 5 indicates that the Source [1] is cited and contributes significantly to the user's understanding and memory of the answer. A number in between indicates the degree of subjective count/rememberance. For example, 3 would mean that Source [1] is cited, with some contribution to the user's understanding and memory of the answer, but it is not particularly memorable.
